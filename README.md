ðŸ“Š Sales Data Dashboard â€“ Excel Project

This project involves analyzing and visualizing sales data using Microsoft Excel. A dynamic dashboard was built
based on customer-wise sales, with breakdowns by year and month. The data was cleaned and transformed to ensure
accurate reporting and insights.

Dataset:
File Name: salesdata.csv
The dataset includes:
Customer Names
Sales Amounts
Order Dates (from which Year and Month were extracted)

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features
PivotTables for Yearly and Monthly analysis
Dynamic summaries of category-wise sales
Cleaned and transformed columns
Visual charts for quick insights.


What I Learned:
How to extract Year and Month from a date field in Excel
How to handle #VALUE! errors in calculated columns
The impact of blank values on PivotTables
Updating PivotTable data ranges and refreshing them.

ðŸ’¡ Challenges Faced
Missing Data: Certain years (2016 & 2017) werenâ€™t showing up in the PivotTable due to a limited data range.
#VALUE! Errors: Caused by incorrect formula references or text-number mismatches.
Blank Fields: Misleading summaries until handled properly.


Solutions Implemented
Expanded the PivotTable data range to include all records.
Used IFERROR() to handle invalid formula outputs.
Ensured consistent formatting in date columns to prevent calculation errors.
